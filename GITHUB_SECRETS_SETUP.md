# Railway Deployment - GitHub Integration (No Secrets Required!)

âœ… **GOOD NEWS**: Your Railway deployment is now working via GitHub Integration!
ðŸš« **NO GITHUB SECRETS NEEDED**: Railway handles authentication automatically.

## Current Setup Status

Your QA Automation Service Hub is deployed using Railway's GitHub Integration, which means:
- âœ… Automatic deployments on every push to main branch
- âœ… No GitHub secrets configuration required
- âœ… Environment variables managed in Railway dashboard
- âœ… Full deployment logs in Railway dashboard

## Automatic Deployment

Once these secrets are set up:

1. **Push to main branch** triggers automatic deployment
2. **Manual deployment** via "Actions" tab â†’ "Deploy to Railway" â†’ "Run workflow"
3. **Check deployment status** in Railway dashboard

## Deployment Process

The GitHub Action will:
1. âœ… Install Railway CLI
2. âœ… Authenticate with Railway
3. âœ… Deploy your application
4. âœ… Set environment variables
5. âœ… Provide deployment status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **RAILWAY_TOKEN not set**
   - Error: "No authentication token provided"
   - Solution: Add RAILWAY_TOKEN secret

2. **Railway project not linked**
   - Error: "No linked project found"
   - Solution: Deploy manually once via Railway dashboard

3. **Build failures**
   - Check "Actions" tab for detailed logs
   - Verify Dockerfile.backend is valid

### Getting Help

- **GitHub Actions logs**: Repository â†’ Actions tab
- **Railway logs**: Railway dashboard â†’ Your project â†’ Deployments
- **Railway Discord**: [discord.gg/railway](https://discord.gg/railway)

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If GitHub Actions fails, you can always deploy manually:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy
railway up
```
